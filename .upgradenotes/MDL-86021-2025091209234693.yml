  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        Add a new modinfo::get_instance_of() to retrieve an instance of a cm via
        its name and instance id. Add a new modinfo::sort_cm_array() to sort an
        array of cms in their order of appearance in the course page. Replaces
        calls to get_course_and_cm_from_instance() and get_instances_of()
        whenever it was just used to retrieve a single instance of a cm.
