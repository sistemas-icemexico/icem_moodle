    - message: >-
        A number of new static methods have been added to
        `core_badges\backpack_api` to support the new Canvas Credentials
        backpack provider. These methods allow you to retrieve lists of
        providers and regions, check if Canvas Credentials fields should be
        displayed, and get a region URL or API URL based on a given region ID.
        The new methods include `get_providers`, `get_regions`,
        `display_canvas_credentials_fields`, `get_region_url`,
        `get_region_api_url`, `get_regionid_from_url`, and
        `is_canvas_credentials_region`.
